# This hook file is located at '/etc/chef/chefctl_hooks.rb'
# You can change this location by passing `-p/--plugin-path` to `chefctl`,
# or by setting `plugin_path` in `chefctl-config.rb`

# Below is a sample hook module with commented out methods for each hook.
# You can use this as a starting point for writing your own hooks,
# just copy this, change the module name, and uncomment the methods you want
# to use.

module SampleHook
  # Used to initialize the hook
  #def initialize
  #end

  # Called during command line option parsing.
  # Allows a plugin to define additional command-line arguments.
  # Parameters:
  # - parser: an OptionParser object
  # The return value is ignored.
  #def cli_options(parser)
  #end

  # Called between command line parsing, and acquiring the lock.
  # This hook is intended to be used to modify config options via
  # Chefctl::Config, or do other setup items for the hooks.
  # Setup items for the chef run should be placed in pre_run, since
  # pre_start is called before the lock is acquired.
  # The return value is ignored.
  #def pre_start
  #end

  # Gets the hostname of the machine. This sets the HOSTNAME environment
  # variable for the chef-client process.
  # Returns the hostname of the machine as a string.
  #def hostname
  #end

  # Validates the authenticity of chef certificates, regenerating
  # them if necessary.
  # The return value is ignored.
  #def generate_certs
  #end

  # Called after the lock is acquired, before the chef run is started.
  # Parameters:
  # - output is the path to the log file for the chef run
  # The return value is ignored.
  #def pre_run(output)
  #end

  # Called after the final chef run completes, before the lock is released.
  # Normally this would be after the first (and only) chef run, but
  # re-runs can be triggered by the `rerun_chef?` hook, in which case
  # this hook is called exactly once after the final chef run.
  # Parameters:
  # - output is the path to the log file for the chef run.
  # - chef_exitcode is the exit code of the final chef-client process.
  #   (>0 on failure)
  # The return value is ignored.
  #def post_run(output, chef_exitcode)
  #end

  # Check whether or not another chef run is required.
  # Parameters:
  # - output is the path to the log file for the chef run.
  # - chef_exitcode is the chef-client exit code. (>0 on failure)
  # Returns a boolean indicating if another chef run should be performed.
  # This hook is called at most `Chefctl::Config.max_retries` times.
  # With the default value of 1 retry, this hook is not called a second time,
  # regardless of the result of the chef re-run.
  #def rerun_chef?(output, chef_exitcode)
  #end
